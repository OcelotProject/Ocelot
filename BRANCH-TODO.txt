TODO:

2. Fix consumption of market group suppliers

    Need to group by reference product, and substitute more than one exchanges at once

    Also need to ignore direct links (might need to flag this earlier)

3. Profile add_suppliers_to_markets

4. Error with current model run

  File "/Users/cmutel/Code/ocelot/ocelot/transformations/locations/linking.py", line 124, in link_consumers_to_regional_markets
    [x['location'] for x in contained])
ocelot.errors.OverlappingMarkets: Multiple markets contain transport, freight train in GLO:
['CH', 'US', 'CN', 'Europe without Switzerland', 'RoW']

5. Log market groups whose constituent markets don't encompass the market group location (#148)

6. Log partially overlapping market groups (#150)

7. Check for overlapping markets - raise error (#151)
